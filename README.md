# Deep Learning Architectures for Argument Mining Tasks
Deep learning architectures for solving the three major argument mining tasks: argumentative fragment detection, argument component classification, and argumentative relation recognition.

## Dataset
The data used are the small version of the decide-madrid-2019 dataset annotated for argument mining tasks.

The corpus is composed of the 40 most controversial proposals, where, collaboratively, the arguments given by citizens in the descriptions and comments of the proposals were searched and annotated.

The first version of this corpus is publicly available in the following <a href="https://github.com/argrecsys/decide-madrid-2019-annotations">repository</a>.
